# Study Objectives

- **1. Is there a relationship between predator size (mass, length) and prey size (mass, length)?**
  
  We predict that there will be a trend of larger predators consuming larger prey, but do not expect it to be universal given the heterogeneity of sampling locations and techniques.
  
- **2. Does the same species of predator in different geographic locations exhibit the same feeding pattern? Are they eating the same sizes of prey in different locations?**
  
  We'd expect the species of prey available to a certain species of predator to vary across space. This might cause changes in the predator-prey size/taxon relationship as prey availability differs. For example, Albacore living off different continental shelves around the world do not all have access to the same prey. Some might feed on Pearlside, while others on Atlantic saury. Given this information, we'd predict that Albacore living off continental shelves closer to one another will eat more similar species of a more similar size.
  
- **3. Does geography (latitude, longitude, geographic location, specific habitat) influence predator and prey sizes (mass or length ratios)?**

  We predict that different locations will exhibit different patterns in the relationship between predator and prey size. This is closely linked with environmental variables, but we'd expect that sites closer to each other might not necessarily have similar relationships because the habitat can change dramatically based on even small distances from shore, etc. 

- **4. Do environmental factors (depth, mean annual temperature, mean primary productivity, specific habitat) influence feeding intractions or predator and prey size relationships (mass, length, fork length)?**
  
  We predict that in areas in which environmental factors are similar, feeding interactions and predator/prey size relationships will show similar trends. For example, in locations with higher mean primary productivity, we'd expect trophic upsurge leading to larger predators and prey, or possibly a greater diversity of prey available to the predator. In contrast, the pelagic zone is nutrient poor, deeper, and generally supports a lower diversity and abundance of fish. This could lead to predator dependence on one kind of fish, as opposed to the competitive but diverse coastal shelves. Differing mean annual temperatures could yield a different diversity of species, as some prey may prefer colder temperatures or warmer tempertatures. This could alter the predator's feeding interactions with prey.

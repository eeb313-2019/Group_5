# Study Objectives

- **Is there a relationship between predator size (mass, length, fork-length) and prey size (mass, length, fork-length)?**
  
  There will be a trend of larger predators consuming larger prey. 
  
- **Does the same species of predator in different geographic locations exhibit the same feeding pattern? Are they eating the same sizes of prey in different locations?**
  
  Locations with more similar environmental factors will have predators exhibiting similar feeding preferences. 
  
- **Does geography (latitude, longitude, geographic location, specific habitat) influence predator and prey sizes (mass or length ratios)?**

  Different locations will exhibit different patterns in predator and prey size. 

- **Do environmental factors (depth, mean annual temperature, mean primary productivity, specific habitat) influence feeding intractions or predator and prey size relationships (mass, length, fork length)?**

 In areas in which environmental factors are similar, feeding interactions and predator/prey size relationships will show similar trends.

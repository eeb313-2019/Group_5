# Mock plots

1. Is there a relationship between predator size (mass and length) and prey size (mass and length)?

Caption: 
Line graph representing a positive correlation between predator size (mass /length) and prey size (mass / length)

2. Does the same species of predator in different geographic locations exhibit the same feeding pattern? Are they eating the same sizes of prey in different locations?

Caption:
a. Bar plot representing the average prey size of specific predators in specific geographic locations
b. Box plot representing the range of prey size of specific predators in specific geographic locations 

3. Does geography (latitude, longitude, geographic location, specific habitat) influence predator and prey sizes (mass or length ratios)?

Caption:
Bar plot representing predator:prey mass ratios in different geographic locations 

4. Do environmental factors (depth, mean annual temperature, mean primary productivity, specific habitat) influence feeding interactions or predator and prey size relationships (mass, length, fork length)?

Caption: 
Line graph depicting how a range of an environmental factors affect predator size 

5. PCA: For relating environmental, geographic, and biological variables to identify potentially important relationships

Caption: Principal component analysis demonstrating the potential sources of differences between sites through relationships between biological, geographic, and environmental variables.

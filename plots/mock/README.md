Is there a relationship between predator size (mass and length) and prey size (mass and length)?
Caption: 


Does the same species of predator in different geographic locations exhibit the same feeding pattern? Are they eating the same sizes of prey in different locations?

Does geography (latitude, longitude, geographic location, specific habitat) influence predator and prey sizes (mass or length ratios)?

Do environmental factors (depth, mean annual temperature, mean primary productivity, specific habitat) influence feeding interactions or predator and prey size relationships (mass, length, fork length)?

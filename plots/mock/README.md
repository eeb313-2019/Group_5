# Mock plots

-Is there a relationship between predator size (mass and length) and prey size (mass and length)?

Caption: 
Line graph representing a positive correlation between predator size (mass /length) and prey size (mass / length)

-Does the same species of predator in different geographic locations exhibit the same feeding pattern? Are they eating the same sizes of prey in different locations?

Caption:
1. Bar plot representing the average prey size of specific predators in specific geographic locations
2. Box plot representing the range of prey size of specific predators in specific geographic locations 

-Does geography (latitude, longitude, geographic location, specific habitat) influence predator and prey sizes (mass or length ratios)?

Caption:
Bar plot representing predator:prey mass ratios in different geographic locations 

-Do environmental factors (depth, mean annual temperature, mean primary productivity, specific habitat) influence feeding interactions or predator and prey size relationships (mass, length, fork length)?

Caption: 
Line graph depicting how a range of an environmental factors affect predator size 

-PCA:
Caption: Principal component analysis demonstrating the potential sources of differences between sites through relationships between biological and environmental variables.

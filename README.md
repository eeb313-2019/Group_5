#Project Description

What is the project about?

-likely using environmental variables.
-standardized variables (names: predator.standard.length or standardized.predator.length???   )
-quality of the data?

*BIOLOGICAL VARIABLES*

-filter unsatisfactory from the data (4 and below)
-using predator standardized length ()


*ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES*


*GEOGRAPHIC VARIABLES*



*Description of the Data*


The authors collated a wide variety of marine predator and prey size data from the literature to create a single data set containing 34931 observations from 27 marine locations representing diverse environmental conditions across the globe. Predator sizes range from 0.1 mg to over 415 kg and prey sizes are as small as 75 pg to over 4.5 kg. Previous analyses focus on small numbers of species with similar sizes, and thus may not have represented trends in other locations. Thus, the data set is intended to address interactions of species and size classes in food webs over a larger size range and considering a greater number of species compared to previous analyses. Prey characteristics were largely assessed from stomach contents of predators, and where their size or mass could not be measured a regression equation was used for mass–length conversion.

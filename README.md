## Introduction to the Project

Our group is interested in the factors influencing predator mass on a global scale. Specifically, we are interested in whether energy availability in a system and the behaviour and lifestage of predators can be used to predict the mass of predators in a general way. Our goal is to gain a greater appreciation of how predator mass ties into understanding marine food webs and their stability (ie ecology is c00l??).

## Data Description

The authors collated a wide variety of marine predator and prey size data from the literature to create a single data set containing 34931 observations from 27 marine locations representing diverse environmental conditions across the globe. Predator sizes range from 0.1 mg to over 415 kg and prey sizes are as small as 75 pg to over 4.5 kg. Previous analyses focus on small numbers of species with similar sizes, and thus may not have represented trends in other locations. Thus, the data set is helpful for addressing interactions of species and size classes in food webs over a larger size range and considering a greater number of species compared to previous analyses. The data was collected in many different ways, including from commercial landings, sportfishing tournaments, purse-seine landings, and handgear landings. This variation will need to be considered in our analysis. Prey characteristics were largely assessed from stomach contents of predators, and where their size or mass could not be measured a regression equation was used for mass–length conversion.

This dataset is beneficial in that it allows us to analyze the interplay between biological, geographical, and environmental variables in interesting ways. It covers several different oceans and includes habitats ranging from coastal to deep sea. There are enough variables to consider the role of environmental conditions (average surface temperature, MPP, depth, habitat type), geography (latitude, longitude), and biology (predator and prey taxa and predator/prey mass and length conveniently standardized).
